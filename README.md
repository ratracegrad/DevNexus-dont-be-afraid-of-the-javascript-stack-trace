# Don't Be Afraid of the JavaScript Stack Trace

This repo contains my slides and code that I used in my presentation. My presentation covered troubleshooting and debugging JavaScript errors.

## How to Use

Everything starts from the ```index.html``` file. Open this file and you will see all the ```<script>``` tags are commented out as well as the javascript code.

As you follow along in the slides just uncomment out the corresponding ```<script>``` tag and/or code that is being covered in the slide. This will allow you to see the results.
